When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Probably I'll need to do that when I am working not on my own laptop, but rather on someone else's or public PC.
    I won't be able to save anything to the computer since I don't want to share the information, but I want to store it, so I would keep
    it online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Say, some of your collaborators added some lines of code to the branch you are currently working on in your local repository. Those lines may introduce some bugs into your work, or they may just be in the different sequence of events, or smth like this, so it's better to manually pull the changes from GitHub rather than doing it automatically.
